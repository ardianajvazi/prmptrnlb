      <p>Welcome! This Pattern Library and Style Guide combines guidelines from Google Material Design, Bootstrap, and Premera. It is meant as a final authority on accepted patterns and styles and their usage. Please reference this document anytime you are building a new design or prototype for release.</p>

      <h4>For Designers</h4>
      <p>This Pattern Library is meant as a <strong>master reference</strong> for modular, reusable, consistent design patterns across Premera's website. This document will continue to grow and change as we add, remove or update our patterns.</p>
      <p>To suggest an update to the Pattern Library, please fill out <a href="">this form on Confluence</a> and submit it to your supervisor.</p>

      <h4>For Prototypers</h4>
      <p>Currently, Google Material Design's "Material Components Web" platform is the quickest and easiest way to get set up with Material Design on a website. This is why we used it to build this Pattern Library and also why we're suggesting it be used by any code-loving designers to build their prototypes. We'll explain everything to you here.</p>
      <p>The quickest way to get started on your first prototype using this system is to download the <a href="">Prototype Template</a>. Everything you need to run this locally exists in this zip. If you want to edit the core styles however, you'll need to install and run <a href="">SASS</a> (it's easy!).</p>

  <h4>How To Update This</h4>
  <p>This is a living document, and will need to be updated with changes to our design system.</p>
