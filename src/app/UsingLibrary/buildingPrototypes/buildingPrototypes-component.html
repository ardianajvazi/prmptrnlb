<h1 class="mdc-typography--display2">Building Prototypes</h1>
<p>This section will guide you through building an interactive, coded prototype using this sytem.</p>

<h2 class="mdc-typography--headline">Setting Up Your Environment</h2>
<p>The Pattern Library and the future Premera website are both built on Angular2. It may look a bit intimidating, but in the end,
  it's very much like HTML and CSS (except the HTML looks a little funny and the CSS is actually SASS).
  The build process (which compiles your SASS into browser-friendly CSS, among other things) happens automatically
  as we update and save our files, and the app is run via <code>npm start</code> so we can
  view it in the browser. Once you run the app, updates will show up automatically. Like magic!</p>
<p>In order to prototype using this sytem, all you have to do is download some files, run a few commands in your terminal, and know
  where to make your updates.</p>

<h2 class="mdc-typography--headline">Starter Template</h2>
<p>The starter template is available on GitHub at: <a href="">REPO LINK FOR TEMPLATE</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>Visit <a href="">GitHub</a> and create an account if you don't already have one.</li>
  <li>Ask <strong>Brian Douglas or Court Crawford</strong> to invite you to the repository (the project containing the files).</li>
  <li>Create a folder on your Desktop or somewhere on your computer.</li>
  <li>Open a terminal</li>
  <li>Navigate to your folder using <code>cd Desktop/library</code></li>
  <li>Type <code>git clone URLGOESHERE</code></li>
  <li>Type <code>cd patternlibrary</code></li>
  <li>Type <code>npm install</code></li>
  <li>Type <code>gulp watch</code></li>
  <li>Open a new terminal window (Command + T on Mac)</li>
  <li>Type <code>npm start</code></li>
  <li>Open up your browser and go to <a href="http://localhost:5000/">http://localhost:5000/</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="mdc-typography--headline">Helper Classes</h2>
<p>There are some useful classes that prototypers can make use of that aren't particularly relevant to static designers. These can be found in PATHTOCSSFILE.</p>
<p>These classes are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>.hide - blah blah blah</li>
  <li>.clearfix - blah blah blah</li>
  <li>.left - blah blah</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
