<p class="mdc-typography--headline">Welcome! This Pattern Library and Style Guide combines guidelines from Google Material Design, Bootstrap, and Premera. It is meant as a final authority on accepted patterns and styles and their usage. Please reference this document anytime you are building a new design or prototype for release.</p>

    <p>This Pattern Library is intended to be a <strong>master reference</strong> for modular, reusable, consistent design patterns for use across Premera's web properties. This document will continue to grow and change as we add, remove or update our patterns.</p>
    <p>To suggest an update to the Pattern Library, please fill out <a href="">this form on Confluence</a> and submit it to your supervisor.</p>

    <p>Our next website redesign will be done using Angular Material (built on Angular 2). This Pattern Library is also built on Angular2, but we've made it as easy as possible for those of you who prefer coded prototypes to get setup and start designing!</p>
    <p>See instructions and tools for prototyping below.</p>
