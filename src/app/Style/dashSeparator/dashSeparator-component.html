  <h1>Dash Separator</h1>
  <h2>em dash (&#8212;)</h2>
  <p>Also known as the long dash. It gets its name from its width&#8212;roughly the same as a capital letter m.</p>
  <p>Em dashes are used with no space between the dash and the words surrounding them.</p>
  <p>Use HTML code &amp;mdash; or &amp;#8212; to display an em dash.</p>

      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Vantage Plus lets you choose benefits based on what's most important to you—cost, maximum choice of doctors, or a specific physician. Do yourself a favor—and reduce paper—by choosing to receive your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) electronically.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>en dash (&#8211;)</h2>
  <p>Also known as the short dash. It gets its name from its width—roughly the same as an N.</p>
  <p>The main use of the en dash is to connect ranges of numbers, dates, or days of the week, such as 2–50 or 1–100.</p>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-11 col-xs-push-1">
      <p><strong>Avoid:</strong> Monday–Friday<br>
      (use "weekdays" instead)</p>
      <p><strong>Avoid:</strong> Monday–Wednesday<br>
      (use "Monday through Wednesday" instead)</p>
    </div>

  <p>Similar to ampersands, the use of the dash causes a cognitive load in the reader. Use "to" instead of an en dash. Exception: when real estate is very tight, such as tables or the mobile app.</p>
  <p>If "from" precedes the range, use "to" between the numbers, instead of an en dash. Do not add a space on either side of a dash.<p>

      <p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> The plan covers employee groups with 2-50 members.</p>

      <p><strong>Correct:</strong> The plan covers employee groups from 2 to 50 members.</p>
